# Introduction to Git

Git is a tool for version control -- a principled way of tracking changes to your code and sharing those changes with others. A version control system allows you to:
* Explore the history of the changes you have made
* Revert to older versions if necessary
* Avoid overwriting others' work

We highly recommend using a version control system like Git with your team throughout the workshop, and this tutorial is aimed to get you up to speed with Git and GitHub.

This tutorial is a condensed version of the [Software Carpentry tutorial on Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Some sections of that tutorial are skipped to give us time to answer questions and discuss.
